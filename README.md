### Change *volume* levels with smooth *fade* transitions

If you're like me, you surely like to hear music while working or maybe you're attending a videocall. Sometimes we need to attend someone requiring our attention and we toggle the mute button; or maybe you're back to work and get a bump surprise when you unmute the volume and only then remember that you left it at a high level. `volfade.sh` makes stepped increase/decrease volume operations in a `PulseAudio` server, making the volume changes to sound with a really smooth *crescendo* or *diminuendo* fade feeling. `volfade.sh` is a bash script wrapper around `pulsectl` and `pamixer` utilities.

## How to use
```
Usage: ./volfade.sh <operation>

Change volume levels with smooth fade transitions.

Operations:
	-d	decrease volume in diminuendo
	-i	increase volume in crescendo
	-m	al niente/dal niente
		(fade out and mute/unmute and fade in)

can't be increased and decreased at the same time
```
